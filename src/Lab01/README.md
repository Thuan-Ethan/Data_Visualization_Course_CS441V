Lab 01 – Introduction to Matplotlib and Line Plots
Course: CS441V – Data Visualization

Objective:
- Learn how to visualize immigration trends using Pandas and Matplotlib.
- Practice line plots, bar plots, and data filtering.

Dataset:
- Canada Immigration Dataset
- Time range: 1980–2013
- Source: Canada by Citizenship (Excel file)

Explain the charts:
## Chart 1: Immigration Trend from Haiti (1980 - 2010)

### Hypothesis
Immigration from Haiti to 
Canada does not increase 
steadily over time but is 
likely to experience a 
sudden surge during years 
affected by major natural 
disasters.

(We can identify several questions by observing the image:
- Is immigration from Haiti stable over time?
- Have there been any years with unusually high surges ?)

### Why this chart
Based on the Hypothesis,
we can draw various types of 
charts: line charts, 
bar charts, area charts, etc.
However, a line chart is 
recommended here because 
it is suitable for tracking 
time periods. It makes it 
easier to detect mutations and 
compare growth trends across different timeframes.

### Explaination
The sharp increase in immigration from Haiti
after 2010 can be linked to the devastating earthquake that 
occurred in Haiti. As a neighboring country in the Americas, 
Canada became an important destination for Haitian migrants 
seeking safety and economic stability.

### Conclusion
From the data, 
we can see that immigration 
from Haiti to Canada from 
1980 to before 2010 tended to 
be around 4000 people. 
However, in 2010, there was a 
sudden surge due to a natural 
disaster (earthquake), 
leading to an increase of over 
6000 immigrants.

## Chart 2: Immigration from China and India (1980 - 2013)
![Immigration from China and India](https://github.com/Thuan-Ethan/Data_Visualization_Course_CS441V/blob/main/assets/china_india.png?raw=true)
### Hypothesis
Immigration from China and India
to Canada shows an overall
increasing trend over time.

(We can identify several questions by observing the image:
- Do both countries have a trend of increasing immigration?
- What is special about the changes in immigration trends in the two countries 
before and after 1997 ?)
### Why this chart
Based on the hypothesis,
we can draw many different types of charts:
line charts,
bar charts, area charts, etc.
However, a bar chart is used here
instead of a line chart because 
the purpose is to compare the 
number of immigrants from China 
and India over the years, to 
identify which country has a 
higher number of immigrants 
in each period.
### Explaination
Both China and India have large populations and
strong economic and migration ties with Canada,
contributing to their sustained high levels of immigration.
### Conclusion
From the data and charts, 
we can see that the number of immigrants
from both China and India showed
a gradual increase between 1980 
and 2013. However, before 1997, 
the number of immigrants from 
India was higher than that from 
China. After 1997, the number of 
immigrants from China began to 
grow significantly faster than 
that from India.
## Chart 3: Immigration trend of top 5 countries (1980 - 2010)
![Immigration trend of top 5 countries](https://github.com/Thuan-Ethan/Data_Visualization_Course_CS441V/blob/main/assets/top_5_countries.png?raw=true)
### Hypothesis
The top 5 countries with the 
highest total immigration to 
Canada are expected to show a 
long-term increasing trend, 
although the growth rate may 
vary among countries.

(We can identify several questions by observing the image:
- Are immigration levels increasing in the top 5 countries over time?
- Which country has the strongest increase ?)
### Why this chart
Based on the hypothesis,
we can visualize the data using different types of charts such as
line charts, bar charts, or area charts.
However, a line chart is used here because the goal is to examine
and compare long-term immigration trends over time among the top
five countries (India, China, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, the Philippines, and Pakistan).

This type of chart allows us to clearly observe how immigration from
each country changes across years and to identify differences in
growth patterns among the countries.
### Explaination
The top 5 countries have high numbers of immigrants due to:
- Large populations (such as China and India)
- Historical and linguistic ties to Canada (such as the United Kingdom)
- Open immigration policies and Canadian labor demand

A clear upward trend after 2000 reflects the impact of globalization and increased international migration.
### Conclusion
From the data and charts,
we can see that immigration from the top five countries to Canada
shows an overall upward trend from 1980 to 2013.
Among these countries, China, India, and the Philippines
show particularly strong growth rates over time,
while the remaining countries show moderate growth or a downward trend.

This suggests that although all the top countries contribute
to the increasing level of immigration, the growth rates vary significantly
among the countries.

# Overall Conclusion
Based on the analysis of all three charts,
immigration to Canada between 1980 and 2013 demonstrates a clear
long-term upward trend, though the patterns vary by country.
While some countries, such as Haiti, experienced sudden spikes
driven by unexpected external events, others like China, India,
and the Philippines showed strong and sustained growth over time.
These visualizations highlight how both gradual trends and exceptional
events contribute to changes in immigration flows, underscoring the
importance of selecting appropriate chart types to effectively reveal
different patterns within the data.
