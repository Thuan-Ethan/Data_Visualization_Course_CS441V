## Chart 1: Immigration Trend from Haiti (1980 - 2010)
![Immigration from Haiti](https://github.com/Thuan-Ethan/Data_Visualization_Course_CS441V/blob/184b454be1721db971a250e195d99200fdace75d/assets/haiti.png)



### Why this chart
Using a line graph will clearly show the change in the number
of immigrants from Haiti over time, allowing us to observe 
long-term trends and sudden fluctuations. For example, 
around 2010, an earthquake occurred in Haiti, 
and the number of immigrants surged to over 6,000 people.

### Explaination
The sharp increase in immigration from Haiti
after 2010 can be linked to the devastating earthquake that 
occurred in Haiti. As a neighboring country in the Americas, 
Canada became an important destination for Haitian migrants 
seeking safety and economic stability.

### Conclusion
The visual representation shows that historically, 
natural disasters or other influences can affect migration patterns.

## Chart 2: Immigration from China and India (1980 - 2013)

### Why this chart
Using a bar chart, you can view the number of migrants 
from China and India, and compare the number of migrants 
from these two countries each year.
### Explaination
Both China and India have large populations and
strong economic and migration ties with Canada,
contributing to their sustained high levels of immigration.
### Conclusion
The data confirms the hypothesis that
populous countries contribute significantly 
to Canada's immigration.
## Chart 3: Immigration trend of top 5 countries (1980 - 2010)

![Immigration trend of top 5 countries](./assets/top_5_countries.png)
### Why this chart
This chart is used to illustrate immigration trends 
from the top 5 countries (India, China, the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
the Philippines, Pakistan) to a specific country 
(possibly the United States or Canada) 
between approximately 1980 and 2013. The main purposes are:
- To compare the number of immigrants from each country over the years.
- To analyze changes in immigration policies, economic conditions, 
or social factors affecting migration flows.
### Explaination
The top 5 countries have high numbers of immigrants due to:
- Large populations (such as China and India)
- Historical and linguistic ties to Canada (such as the United Kingdom)
- Open immigration policies and Canadian labor demand

A clear upward trend after 2000 reflects the impact of globalization and increased international migration.
### Conclusion

Countries with large populations or historical ties
to Canada tend to have high immigration rates,
and line charts are a suitable choice to illustrate this trend.

# Overall Conclusion
The visualizations demonstrate how historical events, population size,
and geographic proximity influence immigration trends to Canada.
